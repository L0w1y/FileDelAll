# FileDelAll
Deletes files from the directory and extension you specified.

# How it works?
It works as follows - In the first line you enter or select the path from where the files will be scanned, In the second field you enter the desired file extensions that you want to delete in the directory and subdirectories.

You can exclude files from the search using the following syntax
For Example: Do you want to delete all files except `.docx` or some other - Use this command in second field: `*.* NOT *.docx` - any other extension can be used instead of `.docx`
